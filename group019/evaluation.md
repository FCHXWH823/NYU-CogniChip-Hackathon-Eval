## Detailed Evaluation

### A) Technical Correctness (0/30)
- Strengths:
  - None — no code or simulation evidence submitted.
- Weaknesses / Missing evidence:
  - `src/5-Stage-Pipeline-RISC-V/` is an empty directory; no RTL, no testbench, no EDA results.
- Key evidence:
  - None.

### B) Effective Use of the Cognichip Platform (0/20)
- Strengths:
  - None.
- Weaknesses / Missing evidence:
  - No DEPS.yml, no EDA results, no ACI interaction logs.
- Key evidence:
  - None.

### C) Innovation & Creativity (6/15)
- Strengths:
  - "RISC-V CPU Design with AI" suggests using AI (Cognichip) to design a 5-stage pipeline RISC-V CPU, which is a relevant application of the platform.
- Weaknesses:
  - 5-stage pipeline RISC-V is a standard design; the AI-assisted design process is the potential differentiator, but it cannot be assessed without artifacts.
- Key evidence:
  - (slides/RISC-V CPU Design with AI.pdf) — concept described

### D) Clarity of Presentation (6/25)
#### D1) Slides clarity (6/10)
- Notes: PDF slides submitted. Content not parseable; scored based on presence.
- Evidence: (slides/RISC-V CPU Design with AI.pdf)

#### D2) Video clarity (0/10)
- Notes: No video submitted. Score is zero per rubric.
- Evidence: `video/` directory does not exist.

#### D3) Repo Organization (0/5)
- Notes: `src/5-Stage-Pipeline-RISC-V/` is an empty directory.
- Evidence: None.

### E) Potential Real-World Impact (5/10)
- Notes: AI-assisted CPU design can accelerate development cycles; a demonstrated working pipeline with AI-generated/verified RTL would have meaningful impact.

### Bonus) FPGA / Tiny Tapeout Targeting (+0/10)
- Notes: No evidence.
- Evidence: None.

## Final Recommendation
- Overall verdict: **Very Poor** (17/110)
- Slides only; no video, no code, no simulation.

## Actionable Feedback (Most Important Improvements)
1. Submit RTL implementation of at least one pipeline stage with a testbench and EDA simulation.
2. Record a demo video showing the AI-assisted design process.
3. Add DEPS.yml and commit Cognichip EDA results.

## Issues (If Any)
- No video submitted; D2 score is zero.
- `src/5-Stage-Pipeline-RISC-V/` is an empty directory; no code submitted.
