Submission to Cognichip hackathon.
The goal was to compare the Cognichip platform as a backbone for the [ROME hierarchical prompting methodology](https://github.com/ajn313/ROME-LLM) which by default uses OpenAI models & the open-source iVerilog simulator and compiler.
I found that Cognichip had equivalent or better performance when utilized as a backbone for the ROME tool, except for the fact that daily message limits are a major disadvantage when attempting fully-automated error handling.

Results for an attempt at generating a combined 128-bit & 256-bit AES architecture (novel in the literature for automated LLM-generated RTL) can be found [here.](https://github.com/ajn313/cognichip-hackathon/tree/main/aes)
