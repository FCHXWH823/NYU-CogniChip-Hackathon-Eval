# CogniChip Hackathon Evaluation Receipt — group010

## Submission Overview
- Team folder: `group010`
- Slides: `slides/CogniChip_Adaptive_Power_Management (Team PowerNap).pdf`
- Video: None
- Code/Repo: `src/` — **empty; no source code submitted**
- Evidence completeness: Very weak — slides PDF is image-based and could not be parsed for text content; no source code, no simulation evidence, no README in repository.

## Detailed Evaluation

### A) Technical Correctness (5/30)
- Applying cap: no concrete simulation/verification evidence whatsoever.
- Strengths:
  - A PDF presentation file exists (~2 MB, suggesting content is present as images/graphics).
  - Project title "Adaptive Power Management" suggests a technically valid topic.
- Weaknesses / Missing evidence:
  - No source code submitted — the `src/` directory is empty.
  - Slides PDF is image-based; text extraction yields only "GitHub Link" — no readable technical content accessible for review.
  - No simulation logs, no waveforms, no testbenches.
  - No README.
- Key evidence:
  - (slides/CogniChip_Adaptive_Power_Management (Team PowerNap).pdf — 2 MB file, image-based, not parseable)
  - (src/ — empty directory)

### B) Effective Use of the Cognichip Platform (4/20)
- Applying cap: no specific steps, features, or evidence of Cognichip usage.
- Strengths:
  - None observable from accessible evidence.
- Weaknesses / Missing evidence:
  - No code, no logs, no screenshots of Cognichip interaction.
  - Cannot assess platform usage without accessible slide content or code.
- Key evidence: None.

### C) Innovation & Creativity (5/15)
- Strengths:
  - "Adaptive Power Management" for a chip design hackathon is a relevant and potentially innovative topic.
- Weaknesses:
  - No accessible technical content to evaluate the innovative aspects of the approach.
- Key evidence: None accessible.

### D) Clarity of Presentation (3/25)
#### D1) Slides clarity (3/10)
- Notes: The slides file exists and is non-trivially sized (~2 MB), suggesting visual content was prepared. However, the file is entirely image-based and could not be parsed by automated tools. Score reflects existence only; content quality cannot be evaluated.
- Evidence: (slides/CogniChip_Adaptive_Power_Management (Team PowerNap).pdf — image-based, ~2 MB)

#### D2) Video clarity (0/10)
- Notes: No video submitted.
- Evidence: No video directory.

#### D3) Repo organization (0/5)
- Notes: No source code, no README, no structure. Empty src directory.
- Evidence: (src/ — empty)

### E) Potential Real-World Impact (3/10)
- Notes: Adaptive power management is a high-impact area in chip design. Without accessible evidence of the specific approach, the score reflects only the topic's general relevance.
- Evidence: None assessable.

### Bonus) FPGA / Tiny Tapeout Targeting (+0/10)
- Notes: No evidence of any FPGA or tapeout work.
- Evidence: None.

## Final Recommendation
- Overall verdict: **Incomplete submission**
- This submission lacks source code, simulation evidence, and accessible slide content. While a PDF presentation exists, it appears to be image-based and cannot be evaluated for technical content. The team clearly prepared visual slides but did not submit code or verifiable technical artifacts.

## Actionable Feedback (Most Important Improvements)
1. Submit source code (RTL or behavioral model) in the `src/` directory.
2. Convert slides to text-searchable PDF or include a README summarizing the project.
3. Include simulation logs or EDA results to demonstrate technical implementation.

## Issues (If Any)
- No source code submitted (`src/` directory is empty).
- Slides are image-based — not parseable for technical content review.
- No video, no README, no simulation evidence.
